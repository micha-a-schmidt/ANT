# ANT

ANT - ANalytic loopTools - is a Mathematica package implementing all Passarino-Veltman functions up to boxes as defined by FormCalc and LoopTools in the limit of vanishing external momenta. Additionally, it includes all first derivatives of B0, B1, C0, C1, C2 as well as C00 in the limit of vanishing external momenta. The current version is ANT 1.2 and it can be installed in any directory by copying the Mathematica package files. Besides the package itself, ANT.m, it contains a tutorial notebook, ANTtutorial.nb, explaining how to use ANT.

If you use ANT in a scientific publication or talk, please give proper academic credit to us by citing our paper: [1308.0463 [hep-ph]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0463).
